## 📖 Description
The code demonstrates creating a map, segment, handling events, noise parameters, and managing visible chunks. It generates a map class, updates visible chunks, and clears current ones. The code calculates pixel position, height, and biome type using river noise, and projects it onto the flow direction. The code can be implemented with a distance threshold or maximum cache size.
